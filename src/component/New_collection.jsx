        description:'Unlike humans, who are able to sweat to lose heat, dogs and cats cannot regulate their temperature in this way and rely mainly on panting and external cooling to lose heat from their bodies. This limits their ability to thermoregulate, which is why pet owners need to take action to minimize the risk of heat stress. Some people profess that they are dog people, while others insist they are cat people. There is also the fear that the cat will be afraid or intolerant of the dogs.'
